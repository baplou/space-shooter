## Space Shooter Game
This Space Shooter Game is similar to Space Invaders.
It was built using Python and Pygame.
Inspiration from [the pygame website](https://www.pygame.org/project/633).
All the assets for the game are made by me, and can be found in [assets](https://github.com/baplou/space-shooter/tree/master/assets).

### Requirements
* Python3
* Pygame

### How to download the game?
```
$ git clone https://github.com/baplou/space-shooter.git
$ cd space-shooter
$ ./game.py
```

### How to play?
To move your player use the arrow keys.
To shoot use space.
The point of the game is to stay alive as much as possible by avoiding the blue enemys moving around the screen.
The longer you stay alive the bigger your score gets.
However, if you shoot an enemy, your score increases by 20.
